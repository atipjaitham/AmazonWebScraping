# Amazon Web Scraping Using Python

## Overview
This Python script performs web scraping on Amazon's product page to extract information such as the product title and price. It periodically checks the price and stores the data in a CSV file. Additionally, it provides an option to send email notifications if the price drops below a certain threshold.

## Project Highlights
- Utilizes BeautifulSoup and requests libraries for web scraping
- Extracts product title and price from Amazon's product page
- Periodically updates the CSV file with the latest data
- Offers an optional feature to send email notifications
- Written in Python

## Project Explanation
In this project, I aim to demystify web scraping by showcasing its applicability beyond just programmers and software developersâ€”it's also a valuable tool for analysts like us! Specifically, I demonstrate how to scrape data from online shopping websites such as Amazon using BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries in Python.

Within the project, I focus on scraping data from a single product on Amazon to test the functionality and deepen my understanding of programming principles. The project comprises Python code files and CSV files generated from the scraping process, where each line of code is meticulously commented to provide detailed explanations of its functionality.

Through this project, I hope to illustrate the accessibility and utility of web scraping techniques for analysts, empowering them to leverage data from various online sources for analysis and insights.
